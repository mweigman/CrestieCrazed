        <h2> Our Guarantee to You</h2>

        <h3>Animal Shipping Guarantee</h3>

        When you place an animal order online, someone will contact you via phone or email within 48 hours to schedule a
        shipping day with you to receive your animal box.
        <p>
            Crestie Crazed guarantees our animals to be alive, healthy, and to your satisfaction upon arrival, and for
            3 days after arrival (amphibians are guaranteed for live arrival only). Notification of dissatisfaction must
            be
            made within 24 hours if you notice any problems upon arrival. If you have any questions or concerns, we
            expect
            you to call us first (we will respond promptly). We do not guarantee animals that are not signed for on the
            first delivery attempt. You must be there and sign for your animal delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shipping for most animal orders is $39.95 plus a $5.95 packing fee that covers all necessary heat packs,
            cold
            packs, styrofoam lined animal shipping box, deli cups, snake bags and other necessary packing materials.
            Live
            arrival can only be guaranteed when temperatures in route are between 35-90 degrees. If the package is
            delayed by
            the
            carrier, our guarantee still applies!
        </p>
        <p>
            We also guarantee the sexing of our animals. If they are listed as males or females at our website, they are
            guaranteed to be as such. A â€œpair" is one male, and one female.
        </p>
        <p>
            We not only breed some of our animals (like sulcatas, tegus, geckos, corns, blood pythons, dart frogs &
            more)! We make sure that
            we
            are offering the highest possible quality animals available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Internal issues on imported animals are not included under our guarantee; it is an outward health guarantee
            only
            on imported animals. Please be aware of what you are purchasing, and do the proper research (and ask us, as
            we
            are very happy to help!).
        </p>
        <p>
            Our guarantee is void if you do not have the proper environment to house the animal in (for example, putting
            a
            bearded dragon in a plastic kritter keeper is not appropriate). This includes temperature, bedding, and
            proper
            lighting.
        </p>
        <p>
            We make every effort to pack animals according to your weather conditions, but can not guarantee animals
            when
            your daytime high temperature is above 90 degrees, or your daytime high temperature is below 35 degrees.
            Crestie Crazed
            is not responsible for freight/shipping charges on the replacement of animals, and there are no
            cash
            refunds of any kind, store credit only.
        </p>
        <p>
            If for any reason you would like to return your animal - you are responsible not only for shipping, but for
            the
            animal to arrive back to us alive and healthy. You must ship the animal back overnight, and pack it properly
            just like we did when it arrived to you.
            If the animal does not arrive back to us in good condition, our guarantee is completely
            void.
